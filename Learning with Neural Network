# Deep learning 
- Deep learning is a technique of machine learning in which hypotheses take the from of complex algebraic circuits with tunable connection strengths 
- imitates the way humans gain certain types of knowledge
- At its simplest, deep learning can be thought of as a way to automate predictive analytics. 

# Neural Network
- is a series of alogorithms that endeavors to reconginvze underlying relationships in a set of data thorugh a process that minimcs the way the human brain operates 
- Neural networks are parallel computing devices, which is basically an attempt to make a computer model of the brain.

# Artificial neural network 
- are computing systems inspired by the biological neural network that constitue the animal brain  
- main objective is to develop a system to perform various computational task faster than the traditional systesm 
- parallel distributed processing systems

# Artificial neural network architecture 
 1) input layer
 2) Hidden layer
 3) output layer 

Activation functions 
1) Sigmoid funciton
2) ReLu fucntion
3) tanh function
