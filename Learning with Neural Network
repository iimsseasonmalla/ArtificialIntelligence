# Deep learning 
- Deep learning is a technique of machine learning in which hypotheses take the from of complex algebraic circuits with tunable connection strengths 
- imitates the way humans gain certain types of knowledge
- At its simplest, deep learning can be thought of as a way to automate predictive analytics. 

# Neural Network
- is a series of alogorithms that endeavors to reconginvze underlying relationships in a set of data thorugh a process that minimcs the way the human brain operates 
- Neural networks are parallel computing devices, which is basically an attempt to make a computer model of the brain.
