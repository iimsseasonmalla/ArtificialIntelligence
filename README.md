# ArtificialIntelligence
second semester artificial intelligence course 


# unit 1: Introduction 

## **AI**
- is a branch of Science which deals with helping machines finding solutions to complex problems in a more human-like fashion.
- involves borrowing characteristics from human intelligence, and applying them as algorithms in a computer friendly way.

### **AI Perspectives**
-2 dimensions 
1. human vs. rational
2. thought vs. behavior

From these dimension we have 4 possible combinations
  1. Acting humanly
  2. Thinking humanly
  3. Thinking rationally
  4. Acting rationally

### **ACting Humanly (The turing test)**
- proposed by Alan Turing (1950)
- was designed as a thought experiment that would sidestep the philosophical vagueness of the question “Can a machine think?” 
- For Machines to think, we would need:
  - natural language processing to communicate successfully in a human language; 
  - knowledge representation to store what it knows or hears;
  - automated reasoning to answer questions and to draw new conclusions;
  - machine learning to adapt to new circumstances and to detect and extrapolate patterns
- To pass the total Turing test, a robot will need 
  - computer vision and speech recognition to perceive the world; 
  - robotics to manipulate objects and move about.
