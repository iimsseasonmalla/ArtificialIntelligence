# ArtificialIntelligence
second semester artificial intelligence course 


# unit 1: Introduction 

## **AI**
- is a branch of Science which deals with helping machines finding solutions to complex problems in a more human-like fashion.
- involves borrowing characteristics from human intelligence, and applying them as algorithms in a computer friendly way.

## **AI Perspectives**
-2 dimensions 
1. human vs. rational
2. thought vs. behavior

From these dimension we have 4 possible combinations
  1. Acting humanly
  2. Thinking humanly
  3. Thinking rationally
  4. Acting rationally

### **ACting Humanly (The turing test)**
- proposed by Alan Turing (1950)
- was designed as a thought experiment that would sidestep the philosophical vagueness of the question “Can a machine think?” 
- He suggested a test based on indistinguishability from undeniably intelligent entities- human beings.
- The test involves an interrogator who interacts with one human and one machine. Within a given time the interrogator has to find out which of the two the human is, and which one the machine.
- The computer passes the test if a human interrogator after posing some written questions,cannot tell whether the written response come from human or not.
- For Machines to think, we would need:
  - natural language processing to communicate successfully in a human language; 
  - knowledge representation to store what it knows or hears;
  - automated reasoning to answer questions and to draw new conclusions;
  - machine learning to adapt to new circumstances and to detect and extrapolate patterns
- To pass the total Turing test, a robot will need 
  - computer vision and speech recognition to perceive the world; 
  - robotics to manipulate objects and move about.
- Turing test avoid the physical interaction with human interrogator. Physical simulation of human beings is not necessary for testing the intelligence.

### **Thinking Humanly : Cognative modeling approach**
-If we are going to say that a given program thinks like a human, we must have some way of determining how humans think.
- learn about human thought in 3 ways 
  1. introspection
  2. pyschological experiments
  3. brain imaging 
- Once we have precise theory of mind, it is possible to express the theory as a computer program.
- The field of cognitive science brings together computer models from AI and experimental techniques from psychology to try to construct precise and testable theories of the workings of the human mind.

### **Thinking rationlly: The law of thoughts**
- Aristotal was one of the first who attempt to codify the right thinking that is irrefutable reasoning process.
- He gave Syllogisms that always yielded correct conclusion when correct premises are given.
- For example:
    Ram is a man
    All men are motral 
    => Ram is mortal
- These law of thought were supposed to govern the operation of mind

### Acting Rationally: The rational Agent Apporach 
- Agent is something that acts.
- Computer agent is expected to have following attributes:
    1. Autonomous control
    2. preceiving their environment
    3. Persistinf over a prologed period of time 
    4. Adpating to change 
    5. capable of taking on another’s goal
- The right thing: that which is expected to maximize goal achievement, given the available information.
- Rational Agent is one that acts so as to achieve the best outcome or, when there is uncertainty, the best expected outcome.

## **Foundation of AI**
1. philosopy 
    - Logic, reasoning, mind as a physical system, foundations of learning, language and rationality.
    - some example
      - Where does knowledge come from?
      - How does knowledge lead to action?
      - How does mental mind arise from physical brain?
      - Can formal rules be used to draw valid conclusions?
2. Mathematics
    - Formal representation and proof algorithms, computation, undecidability, intractability, probability.
    - some example 
      - What are the formal rules to draw the valid conclusions?
      - What can be computed?
      - How do we reason with uncertain information?
3. Economics
    - Formal theory of rational decisions, game theory, operation research.
    - some example 
      - How should we make decisions so as to maximize payoff? 
      - How should we do this when others may not go along?
      - How should we do this when the payoff may be far in future?
4. Neuroscience
  - Physical substrate for mental activities
  - some example 
      - How do brains process information?
5. Psychology
  - Adaptation, phenomena of perception and motor control.
  - some example 
      - How humans and animals think and act?
6. Computer Engineering 
  - How can we build an efficient computer?
7. Control theory 
  - Homeostatic systems, stability, optimal agent design
  - some example 
    - How can artifacts operate under their own control?
8. Linguistic
  - Knowledge representation, grammar
    - How does language relate to thought?
