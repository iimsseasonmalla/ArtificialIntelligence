# Unit 5 Machine Learning 

**learning**
- learning donotes changes in the system thatare adaptive iun the snese that they enable the system to do the sam etask more effectively the next time.

**Machine Learning **
- Machine learning is about extracting knowledge from the data. 
- is a subfield of AI, which enables machine sto learn from past data or expreiences wiothpout being explicitly prgrammed 
- two concept of machine learning
 1. Supervised
 2. Unsupervised 

**Supervised Learning**
- agent observes some example input–output pairs and learns a function that maps from input to output. 
- The task of supervised learning is this:
      Given a training set of N example input–output pairs
        (x1, y1), (x2, y2), . . . (xN, yN) ,
  where each yj was generated by an unknown function y = f(x), discover a function h that approximates the true function f.
  Here x and y can be any value; they need not be numbers. The function h is a hypothesis
- Learning is a search through the space of possible hypotheses for one that will perform well, even on new examples beyond the training set.
